# FuzzyCode Exploration Summary

## Overview
FuzzyCode is a code generation platform that requires authentication for generating code. The interface features a main textarea for prompts and various UI controls.

## Key Findings

### 1. Authentication Required
- Anonymous users receive 401 errors when attempting to generate code
- Login is accessible via a small profile icon in the left sidebar at coordinates (49, 375)
- Login form appears in an iframe modal with username/email and password fields

### 2. Login Process
- **Critical Discovery**: The login form has multiple input fields (11 total, including hidden)
- **Solution**: Use direct array access - inputs[0] for username, inputs[1] for password
- Successfully logged in with test credentials: robert.norbeau+test2@gmail.com
- Welcome modal displays after successful login

### 3. UI Components
- **Main Interface**: Large textarea with "Enter your request here..." placeholder
- **Primary Button**: "Fuzzy Code It!" for code generation
- **Top Bar**: Create, Update, Save/Load/Share buttons
- **Additional Features**: Clear, Suggest Fixes, Edit Code, Take Screenshot, Publish buttons
- **Dropdowns**: 2 found, including "Choose something to make..."

### 4. Technical Architecture
- Uses iframes for login modal (https://fuzzycode.dev/user_login)
- Same-origin iframe allows form manipulation
- Console logging reveals authentication errors
- Network monitoring shows API calls to /prompt_to_code endpoint

### 5. Current Limitations
- Welcome modal persists after login, blocking further interaction
- Code generation for authenticated users not fully tested
- Some UI elements (theme options, version selector) not clearly identified

## Recommendations for Future Exploration
1. Find way to close welcome modal (X button not working, backdrop click failed)
2. Test authenticated code generation once modal is closed
3. Explore the dropdown menus functionality
4. Test Save/Load/Share features
5. Investigate "Suggest Fixes" and "Edit Code" buttons
6. Verify logout functionality

## Code Generation Status
- ❌ Anonymous: Blocked with 401 error
- ⏸️ Authenticated: Login successful but testing incomplete due to modal

## Browser Automation Insights
- Iframe access requires checking document readiness
- Form validation may require filling ALL required fields
- Direct array access (inputs[0], inputs[1]) more reliable than selector queries
- Modal/overlay interactions can be challenging - multiple close methods needed
