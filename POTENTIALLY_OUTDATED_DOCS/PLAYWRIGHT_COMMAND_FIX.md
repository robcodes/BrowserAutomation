# Playwright Command Execution Fix

## Problem

The browser automation UI was generating Playwright commands with `await` syntax:
```javascript
await page.click({position: {x: 968, y: 37}});
```

However, the server's `/command` endpoint was using `page.evaluate()` to execute these commands, which runs JavaScript in the browser context where top-level `await` is not valid. This resulted in the error:
```
SyntaxError: await is only valid in async functions and the top level bodies of modules
```

## Solution

Updated the `/command` endpoint in `browser_server_enhanced.py` to:
1. Parse Playwright commands and execute them directly on the Python `page` object
2. Automatically handle `await` prefix (can be included or omitted)
3. Support common Playwright commands:
   - `page.click()` (with selectors or position coordinates)
   - `page.type()` (with or without selector)
   - `page.fill()`
   - `page.goto()`
   - `page.screenshot()`
   - `page.press()`
   - `page.select_option()`
   - `page.wait_for_selector()`
   - `page.wait_for_timeout()`
   - `page.reload()`
   - `page.go_back()`
   - `page.go_forward()`

## Updated UI

The enhanced UI (`index_enhanced.html`) now:
- Shows clear instructions about command format
- Generates commands without `await` prefix for consistency
- Provides helpful examples in the placeholder text

## Usage Examples

### Via the UI
1. Start a browser session
2. Take a screenshot and detect elements with Gemini Vision
3. Click on detected elements - the generated code will be:
   ```javascript
   page.click({position: {x: 100, y: 200}});
   ```

### Via the API
```python
# Using CrosshairBrowserClient
client = CrosshairBrowserClient()
session_id = await client.create_session(headless=False)
page_id = await client.new_page()

# Execute Playwright commands - with or without await
result = await client.execute_command(
    session_id, 
    page_id,
    "page.click({position: {x: 400, y: 200}})"
)

# Also works with await prefix
result = await client.execute_command(
    session_id,
    page_id, 
    "await page.click({position: {x: 400, y: 300}})"
)
```

### Direct HTTP API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/command \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session_id": "abc123",
    "page_id": "def456",
    "command": "page.click({position: {x: 100, y: 200}})"
  }'
```

## Benefits
1. **Compatibility**: Works with both `await` and non-await syntax
2. **Direct execution**: Commands run directly on Playwright page object
3. **Better error messages**: Clear feedback about what succeeded/failed
4. **Type safety**: Proper parsing of arguments instead of string evaluation
5. **Security**: No arbitrary JavaScript execution in page context
