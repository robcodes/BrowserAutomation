The main goal of this whole project is that I could open you (claude code) and give you a direction like \"explore Fuzzycode.dev\" or \"explore humanmeetsdigital.com\" and have you explore and document it, and you'd have a process for yourself that is clear and concise in md files for tracking what you've seen so far and what you have to explore, a place for you to store notes, and also that you have all the working tools for you to be able to navigate by clicking, typing in username / password where needed, closing modals, changing tabs, whatever a user would do, while taking screenshots each time and you look each time at the screenshot to decide if it worked or not, you being able to take screenshots where you put crosshairs before a click to verify where you are clicking is correct by you looking at te screenshot. The server we us is browser_server_enhanced. We are using fuzzycode as the first site that we try this on, but we want everything to be generalizable.
